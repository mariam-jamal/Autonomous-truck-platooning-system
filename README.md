# Modelling and development of an Autonomous Truck Platooning System
Truck platoon is a solution for truck transportation in highways. It is a very simple idea of making trucks drive together in a section of highway lane with a predefined distance between trucks to maintain safe clearance. The trucks drive with the same velocity and coordinates between each others. This coordination contains exchanging messages and data between vehicles.  
This technology has great benefits such, first it reduces the air drag so better fuel efficiency. Second is reduction of congestion in highway and better utilization of roads resources. Lastly, less traffic collisions. 

This project is a part of the Mechatronics Systems Engineering Module.
In this project, we have applied Mechatonics System Engineering Approach for Truck Platoon System. It includes application of CONSENS method, Modeling via SysML, Behavior implementation using time automaton on UPPAAL, Cognitive Operator and CARLA simple scenario implementation. 

For running the CARLA:
First run environment.py and then in a separate  command windows run platoon_carla.py
